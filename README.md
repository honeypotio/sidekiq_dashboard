with the name `sidekiq-dashboard`

Example command for creating the configuration:
```
kubectl create configmap sidekiq-dashboard \
  --from-literal staging-projectname-user=admin \
  --from-literal staging-projectname-password=admin
  --from-literal staging-projectname-redis_url=redis://10.0.1.1:6379
```

### Continuous Deployment

maser is being built and deployed as "staging"
and all git tags (v.X.x.x) on the repo are deployed as "production"
